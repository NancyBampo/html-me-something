                <h3>Christmas is a commercialized holiday and I want to spend some time telling you why I love it despite all of that.</h3>
                    <p>Christmas in my opinion,is great if you decide to make it about the things you<br>
                            you appreciate and cherish in life. When everything about Christmas is about buying<br>and getting and selling and loss, it becomes very easy to despise it.<br>
                            Even though I have lost and had a rough year, I still am very greatful for the things I gained and have.<br>This reason is why I live Christmas.</p>

                        <li>I want more laughter this Christmas. It sounds cheesy but laughter<br>was not my friend this year, so i want more of it.</li>
                        <li>On a lighter note; I want to party. I want to throw a big party on Christmas day.</li>
                        <li>I want to finally pull a successful prank on my husband</li>
                        <li>I want a puppy(probably far fetched, but hey a girl can dream)</li>
                        <li>Lastly, I want more food. hahaha</li>
                    </ul>
